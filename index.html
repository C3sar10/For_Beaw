                I know I couldn't be with you today but I wanted to do something for you to show you how much I appreciate you and how much I love you for being my girlfriend. Then I thought, "Hey I am a CS major why not do something special for her." I really hope you enjoy this little project I made for you as a place holder for being able to show you love for national girlfriend's day, I love you beaw.
